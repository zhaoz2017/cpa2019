      <p class="lead text-muted">This project will aid students in planning their class schedules at Florida Tech effectively, so they may graduate in a timely manner. Given the studentsâ€™ personal combination of completed courses for their major and the degree plan offered to incoming freshmen of the same major, the system will present the user with possibilities effective for staying on track to graduate on time. Through the experience of other users, the system can learn more about student options and provide this knowledge to new students.</p>
